# Early access {#early-access}

We have already discussed the early access in the [Payment Model](/chat/payment-model) of Chat

We would like to reiterate here that the open source community version will continue to maintain existing functions and bugs in a timely manner

The advanced version is in the early access mode, that is, new functions will be experienced in the advanced version first, and then ported to the open source community version in subsequent updates

The specific time for porting the advanced version to the open source version is **not fixed**

In the following function chapters, the functions with the following marks are only available in the advanced version
