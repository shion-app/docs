# Quick Start

Now it only takes a few minutes to quickly understand the functions of shion

It is generally divided into two parts, namely **recording** and **display** of data

## Recording

### Automatic Recording

Select a series of software that you **need to monitor**, and shion will monitor and collect their activities

Their mouse, keyboard, and audio activities will all be monitored

[Details](./record.md#automatic)

### Manual Recording

Manually create the corresponding **data set**, manually time or directly enter data

[Details](./record.md#manual)

### Note Records

Is it too boring to only record the time? Use obsidian (a writing app) notes as markers

[Details](./record.md#obsidian)

## Display

### Chart display

Create custom charts for display

[Details](./display.md#chart)
