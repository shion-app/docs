## Did I encounter a problem?

Often, you need to confirm that you **really** have a problem, check the tutorials and existing documents

## I have a problem, how can I report it?

In the `Help` on the top bar of the program, click `Open log folder` to find the log file

If you cannot open the software, there is a log file in the location `C:\Users\{replace with your user name}\AppData\Local\hanaTsuk1.shion\logs`. Submit the log file to the developer and describe the problem

> Users using the open source version

Submit it on [github](https://github.com/shion-app/shion/issues), and you can search whether the same problem already exists

> Users using the steam version

The log path changes from `hanaTsuk1.shion` to `hanaTsuk1.shion.pro`

Submit it on [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/3026040/discussions/) or [github](https://github.com/shion-app/shion/issues), and you can search whether the same problem already exists

Or in `Help`, click `Open Developer Tools`, find `Console` in the upper column, and look for errors with a red background. (I usually recommend sending the full log file.)

## The first time you open the software, it is blank

You may have encountered the same situation as [this user](https://github.com/shion-app/shion/issues/36), which cannot be solved for the time being

If not, you can use the shortcut key `ctrl+shift+i` to open the developer tool

## How to migrate data?

For example, I use the open source version and now want to migrate the data to the advanced version

Click `View`-`Import and Export`, export the data as a compressed package in the `Open Source Version`, and then import the data in the `Advanced Version`

## Windows Security Center prompts virus

Normal phenomenon, the software is not signed, please confirm whether to use it
