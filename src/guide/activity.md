## Activity

The application will record all programs in the listening list

Triggered actions include: **Mouse** (except mouse movement), **Keyboard**, **Audio**

When the mouse or keyboard is active, the corresponding active program is recorded as a foreground program. When switching to a different program, the sign in the foreground switches accordingly, and one recording is completed.

Sometimes you may not perform operations for a period of time, and the foreground program will automatically end its active state after **one minute**

However, some programs are still within the scope of recording even though they are not actively operating. When a program plays audio, it is considered a background program (multiple background programs can exist). When playback ends, one recording is completed

Sometimes the foreground and background states exist at the same time. In this case, a recording will be completed only when both states disappear.
