## Apple calendar {#apple-calendar}

Upload local **manual timing** and **automatic timing** data to Apple Calendar in real time through iCloud

Set the corresponding calendar name for the current device to upload (**do not change it at will**, you need to log in again after modification, and keep the calendar with the same name in iCloud)

Enter the Apple account ID and app-specific password. For the specific password setting, see [this link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654)

When the status bar shows that the calendar service is available, data can be pulled and pushed normally

::: tip

Remember to turn on the icloud calendar

:::

::: warning

For the speed of pulling data, all calendar lists will only be obtained when logged in

This means that if you modify the iCloud calendar list (such as changing the name, color, adding a new calendar range), you must **log in again**

:::

::: warning Why is the displayed data different from Apple Calendar?

The data uploaded locally is the same as the data received by Apple Calendar, but the local will splice and display the data of **adjacent categories**, so there will be differences
