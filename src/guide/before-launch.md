## Title bar {#title-bar}

Although there's not much to talk about here, I still need to tell you that **setting** and **developer Tools** are here

## Nav bar {#nav-bar}

An ordinary navigation bar, but hidden at the bottom of this page's **menu option**. whether they exist or not, this is a question

## Status bar {#status-bar}

Typical programming software only has a status bar that displays status and shortcut buttons
