# No mac

Flow-saving version: fill in the pitsðŸ˜´ open new pitsðŸ˜Š

Before I got the Mac, I was still thinking about what needs to be adjusted. But when I got the Mac, installed the environment, and ran it, I looked at the dense errors and fell into deep thought. Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?

After exiting vscode, I felt relieved. Maybe I should start a new journeyðŸ˜Ž

Just as I slapped my head at the beginning, this project was established. Based on the principle of using what can be used and adding what you want, this project has now become a patchwork monster without a plan. There was no plan for rigid needs such as multi-device synchronization at the beginning, and now it is a bit difficult to add it. During the development process, I learned about the Caldav protocol for the first time, and various calendar services were added through this standard. There are countless functions

I now need to start planning again and make it clear that **I will not develop a Mac version of the current application**, and this project will also become inactive afterwards

The open source version transplants the `time block` function at this stage
