# Summary

In a blink of an eye, 2024 will also come to an end. When I don’t have a job, I just type some code and play around for a day, and a day goes by quickly after I have a job.

From aimlessness at the beginning of the year to the popularity of the attempted promotion in April, after a period of rapid updates, and finally returning to the quiet present. Continuously moving towards the unknown and getting feedback from it is the best gain of this journey. Ideas are still coming one after another, and I still have the passion to create better works, which is the most important

Finally, after nearly two months of squeezing toothpaste, the `summary report` is finally completed, and the function is barely acceptable. It’s just that the content of the summary is not so good. After all, it will not last long if you lose your passion and rely solely on your will

Finally, I still have a lot of ideas, but I don’t plan to spend too much energy on this at the moment, and I’ll just patch it up and use it. The second generation of awesome is being conceived😶‍🌫️
